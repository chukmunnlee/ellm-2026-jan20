I’d rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop! Hallo here!”\\n\\nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clash, hammer; ding, dong, bell! Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clash, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!\\n\\nRunning to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood to dance to; golden sunlight; heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!\\n\\n“What’s today?” cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.\\n\\n“Eh?” returned the boy with all his might of wonder.\\n\\n“What’s today, my fine fellow?” said Scrooge.\\n\\n“Today!” replied the boy. “Why, Christmas Day.”', '“I don’t know what to do!” cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the same breath, and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with his stockings. “I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy, I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy new year to all the world! Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!”\\n\\nHe had frisked into the sitting room, and was now standing there, perfectly winded.\\n\\n“There’s the saucepan that the gruel was in!” cried Scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace. “There’s the door by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There’s the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present sat! There’s the window where I saw the wandering Spirits! It’s all right, it’s all true, it all happened. Ha, ha, ha!”\\n\\nReally, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!', '“It’s Christmas Day!” said Scrooge to himself. “I haven’t missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!”\\n\\n“Hallo!” returned the boy.\\n\\n“Do you know the poulterer’s in the next street but one, at the corner?” Scrooge inquired.\\n\\n“I should hope I did,” replied the lad.\\n\\n“An intelligent boy!” said Scrooge. “A remarkable boy! Do you know whether they’ve sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there?\\ufeff—Not the little prize turkey: the big one?”\\n\\n“What! the one as big as me?” returned the boy.\\n\\n“What a delightful boy!” said Scrooge. “It’s a pleasure to talk to him. Yes, my buck!”\\n\\n“It’s hanging there now,” replied the boy.\\n\\n“Is it?” said Scrooge. “Go and buy it.”\\n\\n“Walk-er!” exclaimed the boy.', 'It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh.
